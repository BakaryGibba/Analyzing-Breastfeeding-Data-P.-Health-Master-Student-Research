# Breastfeeding Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing breastfeeding data to understand caregivers' knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to exclusive breastfeeding. The dataset includes information on caregiver demographics, breastfeeding practices, knowledge levels, and engagement with community health workers (CHWs). The goal of this project is to uncover insights that can inform public health interventions and improve breastfeeding rates.

---

## Dataset
The dataset contains **391 rows** and **75 columns**, including:
- **Caregiver demographics**: Age, sex, education level, relationship to the child, and location.
- **Breastfeeding practices**: Exclusive breastfeeding rates, feeding frequency, and barriers.
- **Knowledge levels**: Understanding of exclusive breastfeeding and its benefits.
- **CHW engagement**: Frequency of interaction with community health workers and satisfaction with their services.

---

## Project Steps

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- **Handled missing values**: Imputed numerical columns with the median and categorical columns with the mode.
- **Standardized categorical variables**: Converted categorical variables into dummy/indicator variables.
- **Checked for outliers**: Identified and capped outliers in numerical columns.
- **Created new variables**: Derived a "Total Knowledge Score" and a binary "High Knowledge" variable.
- **Renamed columns**: Simplified column names for easier analysis.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Univariate Analysis**: Analyzed the distribution of individual variables (e.g., caregiver age, knowledge scores).
- **Bivariate Analysis**: Explored relationships between variables (e.g., knowledge scores by caregiver sex).
- **Multivariate Analysis**: Visualized interactions between multiple variables (e.g., age vs. knowledge score by relationship to child).

### 3. Statistical Analysis
- **Chi-square tests**: Tested associations between categorical variables (e.g., knowledge levels by caregiver sex).
- **T-tests**: Compared knowledge scores between groups (e.g., mothers vs. other caregivers).
- **Logistic Regression**: Predicted high knowledge levels based on caregiver characteristics.
- **Spearman's correlation**: Assessed relationships between numerical variables (e.g., knowledge scores and perceived benefits).

### 4. Advanced Visualizations
- **Interactive plots**: Created interactive visualizations using Plotly (e.g., breastfeeding rates by district).
- **Heatmaps**: Visualized correlations between numerical variables.

## Key Findings
1. **Caregiver Knowledge Levels**:
   - Mothers tend to have higher knowledge scores compared to other caregivers.
   - Knowledge levels are positively correlated with education level.

2. **Breastfeeding Practices**:
   - Exclusive breastfeeding rates vary significantly by district.
   - Caregivers who interact more frequently with CHWs are more likely to practice exclusive breastfeeding.

3. **Barriers to Breastfeeding**:
   - Lack of family support and work commitments are the most common barriers.
   - Caregivers in urban areas face more challenges compared to those in rural areas.

---

## Future Work
- **Predictive Modeling**: Build a machine learning model to predict exclusive breastfeeding practices.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Create a dashboard to visualize key insights and trends.
- **NLP Analysis**: Analyze open-ended responses to extract additional insights.
