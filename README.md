# Breastfeeding Practices and Knowledge Among Caregivers: A Public Health Research Project

## Overview
This research project analyzes breastfeeding data to understand caregivers' knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to exclusive breastfeeding. The study aims to identify key factors influencing breastfeeding practices and provide evidence-based recommendations for public health interventions. The dataset includes information on caregiver demographics, breastfeeding practices, knowledge levels, and engagement with community health workers (CHWs).

---

## Research Objectives
1. **Assess Caregivers' Knowledge Levels**: Evaluate caregivers' understanding of exclusive breastfeeding and its benefits.
2. **Analyze Attitudes and Perceptions**: Explore caregivers' attitudes toward exclusive breastfeeding and perceived barriers.
3. **Identify Socio-Cultural Factors**: Investigate how socio-cultural factors influence breastfeeding practices.
4. **Evaluate CHW Engagement**: Assess the impact of community health workers on breastfeeding knowledge and practices.

---

## Dataset
The dataset contains **391 rows** and **75 columns**, including:
- **Caregiver demographics**: Age, sex, education level, relationship to the child, and location (district, city, village).
- **Breastfeeding practices**: Exclusive breastfeeding rates, feeding frequency, and barriers.
- **Knowledge levels**: Understanding of exclusive breastfeeding and its benefits.
- **CHW engagement**: Frequency of interaction with community health workers and satisfaction with their services.

## Methodology

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- **Handled missing values**: Imputed numerical columns with the median and categorical columns with the mode.
- **Standardized categorical variables**: Converted categorical variables into dummy/indicator variables.
- **Checked for outliers**: Identified and capped outliers in numerical columns.
- **Created new variables**: Derived a "Total Knowledge Score" and a binary "High Knowledge" variable.
- **Renamed columns**: Simplified column names for easier analysis.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Univariate Analysis**: Analyzed the distribution of individual variables (e.g., caregiver age, knowledge scores).
- **Bivariate Analysis**: Explored relationships between variables (e.g., knowledge scores by caregiver sex).
- **Multivariate Analysis**: Visualized interactions between multiple variables (e.g., age vs. knowledge score by relationship to child).

### 3. Statistical Analysis
- **Chi-square tests**: Tested associations between categorical variables (e.g., knowledge levels by caregiver sex).
- **T-tests**: Compared knowledge scores between groups (e.g., mothers vs. other caregivers).
- **Logistic Regression**: Predicted high knowledge levels based on caregiver characteristics.
- **Spearman's correlation**: Assessed relationships between numerical variables (e.g., knowledge scores and perceived benefits).

### 4. Advanced Visualizations
- **Interactive plots**: Created interactive visualizations using Plotly (e.g., breastfeeding rates by district).
- **Heatmaps**: Visualized correlations between numerical variables.

## Key Findings

### 1. Caregiver Knowledge Levels
- Mothers tend to have higher knowledge scores compared to other caregivers.
- Knowledge levels are positively correlated with education level.

### 2. Breastfeeding Practices
- Exclusive breastfeeding rates vary significantly by district.
- Caregivers who interact more frequently with CHWs are more likely to practice exclusive breastfeeding.

### 3. Barriers to Breastfeeding
- Lack of family support and work commitments are the most common barriers.
- Caregivers in urban areas face more challenges compared to those in rural areas.

### 4. Impact of CHW Engagement
- Frequent interaction with CHWs is associated with higher breastfeeding knowledge and confidence.
- Caregivers who are satisfied with CHW services are more likely to practice exclusive breastfeeding.

## Public Health Implications
1. **Targeted Interventions**: Focus on improving breastfeeding knowledge among non-mother caregivers and those with lower education levels.
2. **Community Health Workers**: Strengthen CHW programs to provide consistent and high-quality support to caregivers.
3. **Addressing Barriers**: Develop strategies to overcome common barriers, such as lack of family support and work-related challenges.
4. **Regional Focus**: Tailor interventions to address the unique challenges faced by caregivers in different districts.
